# Introduction

This R Markdown document demonstrates how to import a dataset, perform a linear regression analysis, and conduct a logistic regression classification analysis.

## Load Required Libraries

```{r, message=FALSE}
# Load necessary libraries
library(ggplot2)   # For data visualization
```

## Import Dataset

We will use the built-in mtcars dataset for this demonstration.

```{r}
# Load the dataset
data <- data(bachelor_dataset.csv)

# Display the first few rows of the dataset
head(data)
```

# Linear Regression

We will perform a linear regression analysis to predict the `Sex` based on `Science and Engineering` (Science and Engineering scores seperated by a comma) of the cars.

```{r}
# Perform linear regression

# Display the summary of the regression model
summary(fit)
```

## Visualize the Regression Line

```{r}
# Visualize the regression line
